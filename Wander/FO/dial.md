Create a top-left control dial for the LEOS simulation UI that matches the existing ambient cyan, futuristic LEOS design language. The dial should appear as a glowing circular interface element with subtle animated accents, such as pulsing rings or rotating overlays, that blends seamlessly into the current simulation visual theme.

When inactive, the dial sits dormant in the top-left corner of the simulation window, styled with soft cyan glows, semi-transparent overlays, and slight reflections or radial light diffusion that reflect LEOS's cyber-aerospace aesthetic.

When clicked, the dial smoothly rotates or unfolds, revealing four clearly defined, vertically aligned buttons that appear to emerge or fan out from the dial’s edge. Each button should include:
- A minimalist icon matching LEOS UI assets
- A label (Clouds, Grid, Moon, Info)
- A glowing or hover-reactive outline

Each button will control a key LEOS simulation toggle:
- “Clouds” toggles the Earth cloud mesh
- “Grid” switches the Earth to a wireframe/grid mode
- “Moon” moves the camera or environment to a lunar scene
- “Info” opens the simulation settings or help panel

The entire dial interface must be non-intrusive and remain fixed to the top-left of the simulation, always visible and responsive without obstructing mission elements or telemetry overlays. It must scale across resolutions and remain consistent with the LEOS First Orbit UI theme.

All visual effects should use ambient cyan glows, soft shadows, and clean glass-like button treatments where possible. Animations should be quick and smooth, matching the feel of LEOS transitions.

This component is part of the LEOS simulation and must feel integrated into the simulation layer, rather than like a separate UI overlay. It is a branded control hub for core simulation settings and should feel immersive, elegant, and efficient.
