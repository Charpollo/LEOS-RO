# LEOS: First Orbit ‚Äì Atmospheric Visual Effects Concept

## Purpose

This proposed feature is part of the evolving **LEOS: First Orbit** simulation platform. It introduces realistic **atmospheric lighting and environmental visuals** to support immersion and educational context in orbit and near-Earth operations.

These effects will enhance the visual experience while reinforcing spatial awareness and conditions that influence real-world satellite missions.

This feature will be built in a modular way to plug into our existing JS + Babylon.js frontend simulation architecture.

## Visual Effects Overview

We aim to simulate dynamic Earth-based and orbital phenomena, including:

### ‚ö° Storm Lightning
- Lightning bolts illuminating cloud masses from within.
- Visible from Low Earth Orbit (LEO), with flashes occurring periodically in storm regions.

### üåå Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights)
- Animated aurora activity near magnetic poles.
- Simulates geomagnetic phenomena caused by solar wind interactions.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Layers & Movement
- Multi-layered clouds with altitude-based parallax.
- Can shift gently or rapidly depending on scenario.

### üåÖ Time-of-Day Light Transitions
- Dynamic orbital lighting conditions as Earth rotates.
- Realistic transitions between day, dusk, night, and dawn.

### üîÜ Sunlight & Solar Glare
- Lens flares and directional brightness depending on satellite/camera angle.

## Target Use in LEOS: First Orbit

These atmospheric visuals will appear in:
- **Main Simulation View**
- **Wander Mode**
- **Static Training Modules**
- **Pre-Mission Briefings (Visual Context)**

They will not interfere with telemetry or performance monitoring but will run in parallel as visual layers.

## Examples & Concepts for Implementation

While not yet implemented, here's how we could achieve this technically:

### Babylon.js Effects
- **Aurora/Northern Lights:** Using dynamic plane meshes with animated shader materials or texture scrolls.
- **Storm Lightning:** Emissive flashes using `spotLights` and `volumetricLightScatteringPostProcess`.
- **Clouds:** Use `SkyMaterial` for layered effects or import `.glb` volumetric cloud assets.
- **Sun Transitions:** Adjust global light intensity, color temperature, and directional light source angles.
- **Dynamic Weather Regions:** Add cloud zones and trigger events in specific coordinates.

### Texture and Shader Libraries
- Utilize Babylon.js's **CustomMaterial**, **ShaderMaterial**, or **Node Material Editor**.
- Leverage assets from:
  - **Poly Haven** (free sky/cloud HDRIs)
  - **Sketchfab** (realistic storm cloud .glbs)
  - **Babylon.js Procedural Textures**

### Animation & Timing
- Built-in animation system using `BABYLON.Animation` to cycle visual states.
- Trigger-based animations tied to time of day, user position, or random intervals.

## Integration Notes

- To be structured as an isolated visual layer module.
- Can be toggled on/off from the LEOS settings or mission setup UI.
- Designed with performance considerations: fallback visuals for low-end systems.
- Fits into the same modular structure as: `earth.js`, `scene.js`, `animation.js` or whatever else make sense for this..

## Summary

**LEOS: First Orbit** aims to redefine how space simulations are visually experienced. By adding high-fidelity atmospheric visuals like lightning storms, auroras, and orbital transitions, users won‚Äôt just simulate ‚Äî they‚Äôll **feel** what it‚Äôs like to be there.

This module brings that realism forward, setting the stage for future expansions while deepening engagement and understanding.
