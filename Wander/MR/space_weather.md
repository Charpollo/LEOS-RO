# 🌌 Environmental Effects Dashboard – LEOS: Mission Ready

### 📁 Feature Module – Included in the LEOS: Mission Ready Simulation Suite

---

## 🛰️ Overview

The **Environmental Effects Dashboard** is a core feature of **LEOS: Mission Ready**, delivering high-fidelity modeling of environmental space hazards and atmospheric anomalies. This dashboard is designed for realistic mission rehearsal, training, and scenario planning involving space weather and its operational impact on satellite systems.

By integrating real and emulated space weather effects, this module helps operators, students, and engineers understand how real-world physics and conditions affect mission performance in orbit and on the ground.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To simulate external environmental factors that impact:

- Satellite orbit dynamics
- Ground station reliability
- Communication and data transfer
- Mission control decision-making

Users will be exposed to realistic anomalies, system alerts, and degraded operational states driven by **space weather**, **geomagnetic events**, and **atmospheric disturbances**.

## 🌐 Key Features

| Feature                        | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **Solar Flare Events**         | Visual and operational disruptions including comms blackouts, heat load spikes, and data loss. |
| **Geomagnetic Storms**         | Simulates effects on ground-based electronics, signal interference, and flux data anomalies. |
| **Aurora & Polar Zone Effects**| Realistic auroral visuals with temporary instrument and guidance instability when traversed. |
| **Radiation Events**           | Introduces shielding considerations, simulated subsystem shutdowns, and telemetry degradation. |
| **Orbital Drag Variability**   | Models increased atmospheric drag at LEO during storm peaks, affecting satellite altitude over time. |
| **Live or Emulated Feeds**     | Ability to switch between NOAA/SWPC data and internally generated simulated weather events. |
| **Real-Time Alert Feed**       | Mission Control HUD notifications triggered by event thresholds or anomalies. |

## 🧪 Example Simulation Scenarios

| Title                      | Scenario Description |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Solar Flare Contingency Drill** | CRTS-1 experiences temporary data blackout — reroute communication via Bulldog and initiate orbit stabilization. |
| **High Drag Window**              | Atmospheric density spikes cause orbital decay — user must analyze telemetry and burn correction. |
| **Magnetic Polar Pass**           | Bulldog passes through polar region triggering temporary sensor anomalies — user must maintain ADCS stability. |
| **Radiation Watch Protocol**      | High radiation event forces shutdown of payload systems. Execute manual reactivation once levels stabilize. |
