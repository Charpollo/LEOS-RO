# 🚀 LEOS: Mission Ready – Simulated Missile & Satellite Launch Animations  
*This feature is in development for the LEOS: Mission Ready environment and is designed to support operational scenarios involving live-launch visualization, early warning training, and real-time educational storytelling.*

---

## Overview  
Modern space and defense operations require the ability to train for and simulate launch-based events — whether civilian, military, or hybrid. This feature adds **visually compelling and data-driven animations of missile and satellite launches from Earth** to support a variety of use cases:

- **Educational modules** on launch dynamics and global positioning
- **Military and security simulations** including early warning drills, ISR triggers, and debris modeling
- **Mission scenario storytelling** where new satellite constellations are deployed or conflicts arise

---

## Key Objectives

- Animate **ground-originating launches** from specific global coordinates  
- Distinguish between **missile vs satellite** launch profiles  
- Integrate with scenario triggers or real-time user input  
- Simulate **orbital injection**, failure points, and tracking  
- Generate debris or alert systems based on trajectory outcomes  

---

## Feature Breakdown

### 🎞️ Launch Animations  
- Fully procedural or scripted launch arcs (missile/satellite)  
- Exhaust trails, booster separations, and trajectory paths  
- Visual effects for cloud glow, launch fire, and sonic pressure

### 🌐 Launch Site Integration  
- Use real-world or fictionalized launchpads  
- Animate assets launching from:
  - Cape Canaveral, Florida  
  - Vandenberg AFB, California  
  - Baikonur, Kazakhstan  
  - Sea-based launch pads (future)  

### 🛰️ Satellite Deployment Mode  
- After liftoff, users can track the satellite post-insertion  
- Link deployed satellite to real-time orbital controls  
- Update Fleet & Assets with new orbital object  

### ☄️ Missile Simulation Mode  
- Tracked as a high-speed kinetic threat  
- Includes ground station alert protocols (if scenario supports)  
- Optional interception, failure, or collision mechanics

### 📡 Alert & Scenario Response  
- Tie launches to global alert systems inside LEOS  
- Trigger simulations: scramble a defense system, begin tracking, launch an intercept, etc.  
- Enable classroom or team-based simulations of political/military space scenarios

## Educational Use Cases  
| Lesson Type               | Scenario Example                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Launch Mechanics 101** | Students watch and analyze a satellite launch trajectory |
| **Early Warning System** | Red team launches a missile from X — Blue team must detect and respond |
| **Orbital Planning**     | Simulate phased satellite deployment during an exercise |
| **International Conflict**| Launch of kinetic weapon triggers simulation escalation |

## Technical Vision

| Component           | Implementation Notes                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Launch Animation**| Babylon.js – keyframe or procedural spline path   |
| **Sound FX**        | Rocket ignition, liftoff, atmosphere entry        |
| **Particle FX**     | Cloud lighting, dust, fuel exhaust                |
| **Object Spawner**  | Ties animation to physical object (sat/missile)   |
| **Tracking Layer**  | Integrates with telemetry and orbit logic         |

## Example Event Flow  

```plaintext
1. User starts scenario
2. System initiates launch from preselected site (or random)
3. Animation plays with full VFX
4. Post-launch:
    - If satellite: injects into target orbit
    - If missile: continues ballistic path
5. System determines trigger outcomes
6. Updates Fleet & Assets or Mission Control accordingly
```

## Security & Operational Considerations  
- All launches are visualized **locally and securely** with no external data dependency  
- Missile paths are fictionalized and non-weaponized for educational clarity  
- Debris generation and interception simulation follow simplified physics  

---

## Summary  
*With launch animation functionality, LEOS: Mission Ready moves beyond passive simulation and enters the world of reactive, cinematic, and immersive mission environments. Whether training analysts on early detection or helping students understand how satellites reach space — this module adds kinetic realism and strategic challenge to any scenario.*
