# 🛰️ LEOS: Mission Ready – External Tool Interoperability  
*This module is being developed as a core feature within the LEOS: Mission Ready environment and is intended for secure government and enterprise deployments.*

## Overview  
As space operations, education, and simulation environments continue to evolve, **interoperability** with trusted industry-standard tools becomes essential. This feature of **LEOS: Mission Ready** allows for **direct integration with external tools and telemetry pipelines**, empowering mission planners, educators, analysts, and operators to bridge LEOS with their existing systems and workflows.

This README outlines the architecture and vision for LEOS’s External Tool Interoperability Layer, ensuring LEOS is not an isolated sandbox—but a **node in your larger space mission ecosystem**.

---

## Objectives  
- Allow real-time or simulated **telemetry export** to external tools  
- Support **bi-directional integration** for control and event ingestion  
- Enable LEOS to act as a visualization layer or logic core depending on need  
- Maintain **configurable plug-and-play options** for specific platforms

## Integration Targets (Current & Planned)

| Tool / Platform         | Type                 | Purpose                                  | Status     |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Grafana**             | Visualization        | Display real-time satellite/system data   | ✅ Available |
| **ELK Stack**           | Logging & Analytics  | Export logs, session data, telemetry      | ✅ Available |
| **Prometheus**          | Metrics              | Capture performance + health stats        | ✅ Available |
| **CesiumJS / Unreal**   | 3D Visualization     | Optional 3D asset sync and mission replay | 🧪 Experimental |
| **STK / AGI**           | External Mission Sim | Import/export satellite data & events     | 🔜 Planned |
| **AstroGrasp, Horus**   | Gov Ops Systems      | Custom compatibility with defense tools   | 🔜 Planned |
| **OpenC3 / COSMOS**     | Command & Telemetry  | Plug LEOS telemetry into existing C2 systems | 🔜 Planned |

## Key Features

### 🔁 Telemetry Streaming
- Select telemetry channels can be **pushed** to external endpoints (e.g. Kafka, WebSocket, REST)  
- Export format includes JSON, CSV, or raw binary depending on destination  
- Custom filters to select what data streams externally  

### 🛠 Data Export Toolkit
- Allow snapshot or historical mission data export  
- Compatible with open-data standards used in satellite ops  
- Auto-generate reports for use in 3rd-party tools (CSV, PDF, JSON)  

### 📥 External Command Ingest
- LEOS can listen for external mission commands from supported platforms  
- Allows integration with classroom dashboards, custom scripts, or SOC tooling  

### ⚙️ Config-First Setup
- Configuration files (YAML/JSON) determine what gets sent where  
- No code changes required to enable/disable integrations  
- Ability to build “integration profiles” (e.g., Classroom Mode, Research Mode, Ops Mode)  

---

## Example Use Cases

### 📡 Training Center Setup  
Instructor wants to **visualize real-time telemetry** from student missions in Grafana, while simultaneously logging actions/events to Elasticsearch for debrief.

### 🛰 Mission Playback  
After a simulation, an AAR requires exporting satellite positioning and decision logs to an analyst using AGI STK for mission modeling.

### 🧪 Cyber Integration  
LEOS is used in a cyber range, exporting **simulated attack telemetry** to a red team ELK dashboard while retaining its own telemetry logs for defenders.

---

## Security Considerations
- All data pathways are encrypted (TLS 1.2+)  
- IP whitelist and user auth required for external endpoints  
- Configurable by system admin; no user can expose data outside sandboxed environments unless explicitly enabled

---

## Folder/Code Structure (Planned)

/plugins/integration/
├── elk-exporter.js
├── grafana-bridge.js
├── telemetry-router.js
├── config/
├── profiles.yaml
└── destinations.json

---

## Future Roadmap
- ✈️ Multi-tenant mission streaming (multiple ops rooms at once)  
- 📶 Direct interface to SATCOM emulators and radios  
- 🧩 Plugin architecture for 3rd party or classified system extensions  

---

## Summary  
*LEOS: Mission Ready is not just a training simulator — it’s an adaptable node in your mission command fabric. This integration layer ensures your teams can train, test, and simulate within LEOS while leveraging your existing infrastructure to observe, analyze, and act.*
