# 🧩 User-Built Missions & Training Modules – LEOS: Mission Ready

### 📁 Feature Module – Advanced Scenario Builder for Educators, Trainers, and Operators

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **User-Built Missions & Training Modules** feature transforms **LEOS: Mission Ready** from a predefined simulation suite into a fully **customizable learning and mission operations environment**. This tool allows users to design, script, and deploy their own mission or training simulations using a modular framework — no coding knowledge required (unless desired for advanced logic).

Instructors can build training pipelines, students can learn through mission-based learning, and professionals can replicate real-world procedures or anomalies for hands-on readiness drills.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Enable **modular mission/training creation** within the LEOS platform.
- Support **hands-on learning** through customized, scenario-driven engagement.
- Allow agencies, schools, and companies to **replicate real or fictional operations** for specific outcomes.
- Provide a **scalable architecture** to import/export, archive, and share created missions.

## 🧪 Intended Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **University Aerospace Course** | Instructor creates satellite deployment mission for students to complete and report on. |
| **Cyber Training for Space Assets** | Simulate signal jamming during pass over a contested region; students must mitigate. |
| **Disaster Scenario** | Simulate power outage at a ground station and execute manual reconnection procedures. |
| **Anomaly Response Drill** | Introduce unexpected satellite telemetry behavior — assess operator diagnostic response. |
| **Mission Planning Competition** | Students build and run their own mission from scratch to meet defined criteria. |

## 🧩 Builder Modes

| Mode             | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Visual Editor** | Web-based or in-sim GUI for drag-and-drop layout of environment and logic. |
| **Scripted Mode** | For advanced users to use JSON or JS-based scripting to automate and define mission flow. |
| **Template Starter Kits** | Prebuilt missions that can be duplicated and customized to reduce build time. |

---

## 🌐 Integration Scope

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Training Section** | Build or assign custom modules per user or team. |
| **Mission Hub** | Launch or assign created missions under custom categories. |
| **Post-Mission Report** | Analyze performance against the creator’s defined metrics. |
| **Fleet & Assets** | Select assets to be used in simulation from library or custom uploads. |
| **User Accounts** | Tie custom missions to users, instructors, or teams. |

---

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple instructors/students editing and monitoring in parallel.
- **Cloud Library**: Store and share custom-built missions with community or private network.
- **Voice/NLP Logic**: Allow natural language creation or control of mission events (e.g., “Add solar flare after 2 minutes”).

## ✨ Summary

The **User-Built Missions & Training Module** capability turns LEOS into a **platform**, not just a simulation. It enables scalable, adaptive learning and scenario control — across academic, commercial, and government users. Through a balance of visual simplicity and logical power, this system will become the **backbone for custom, targeted simulation engagement.**
