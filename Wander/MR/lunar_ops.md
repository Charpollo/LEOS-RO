# 🌕 Lunar Surface Operations – LEOS: Mission Ready

### 📁 Feature Module – Included in the LEOS: Mission Ready Simulation Suite

---

## 🛰️ Overview

**Lunar Surface Operations** is a dedicated simulation environment within **LEOS: Mission Ready** that allows users to plan, train, and execute surface-level missions on the Moon. This environment supports a wide range of operational use cases, from lunar EVA rehearsals and rover navigation to base communications and payload deployment.

By providing a realistic, data-rich representation of the Moon, this module enables mission designers, trainees, and educators to experience the complexities of lunar environments — from lighting challenges and reduced gravity to communications delay and surface terrain mapping.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To simulate and prepare for:

- Surface operations under Moon-specific physics
- Habitat and asset deployment
- Communication strategies under delay and occlusion
- Training for astronauts, rover operators, and lunar system engineers

## 🌐 Key Features

| Feature                           | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Lunar Terrain Rendering**       | High-resolution lunar topography using real elevation datasets (e.g., LRO data). |
| **Rover Navigation**              | Control and plan rover missions with terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. |
| **Simulated Lunar EVA**           | Simulate astronaut movement, equipment handling, and hazard navigation. |
| **Habitat & Base Building**       | Deploy and visualize modular lunar bases, antennas, power systems, and science stations. |
| **Light & Shadow Cycles**         | Extreme light/shadow conditions simulated with real-time solar incidence at location. |
| **Lunar Gravity & Physics**       | Adjusted movement, fall distance, jump dynamics, and debris interaction based on 1/6g. |
| **Delayed Comms / LOS Simulation**| Simulate line-of-sight disruptions and time-delayed communication to/from Earth. |
| **Surface Telemetry & Health**    | Track environmental data like dust, radiation, battery levels, and mission clock. |

## 🧪 Example Simulation Scenarios

| Title                     | Scenario Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **EVA Walk to Relay Site** | Astronaut must traverse crater terrain to manually deploy a backup comms relay. |
| **Rover Navigation Test**  | A terrain-mapping mission across a ridge with onboard sensors and telemetry returns. |
| **Power Outage Response**  | A solar array fails after dust impact — user must navigate back to base and recover power. |
| **Night Ops Prep**         | Prepare the lunar station for the 14-day night cycle. Resource management is critical. |
