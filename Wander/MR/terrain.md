# 🌄 LEOS: Mission Ready – Terrain & Ground Station Scene (Concept Stage)

## Overview

This repository contains the **concept and early planning** for a future environmental module within **LEOS: Mission Ready**, focusing on creating **natural Earth-based terrain scenes** such as foothills, mountains, and grassy fields—complete with **interactive ground stations** and real-time satellite operations.

This idea is staged for eventual inclusion in LEOS, with a dedicated testbed scene to be built as a separate branch of our existing codebase.

---

## Purpose of the Scene

- **Visual & Tactical Immersion:** Showcase realistic environments like mountain foothills, desert plains, or remote forested areas where ground stations might exist.
- **Mission Scenario Enhancement:** Provide a more contextual setting for training, satellite uplink/downlink visuals, and Earth-based support systems.
- **Camera Exploration:** Allow users to orbit, fly over, or even explore in first-person mode.
- **Integration with Other Modules:** Serve as a foundation for use in **simulation training**, **mission replays**, and **Wander Mode** visual exploration.

---

## Key Concepts to Explore

- 🌍 Procedurally rendered terrain (e.g., grass, rocks, elevation changes).
- 🛰️ Ground station models (via `.glb`) realistically positioned in environment.
- ☁️ Realistic skybox, day/night cycles, and light fog for depth.
- 👣 Potential to add **first-person or third-person navigation**.
- 🎮 Future support for gamepad or mouse/keyboard movement.

## Tooling & Stack Compatibility

This module will be fully compatible with our **Babylon.js + JavaScript + CSS** stack, reusing parts of the LEOS simulation engine.

### Existing Code Integration
- Reuses core Babylon scene setup (`scene.js`)
- Follows modular JS structure (`main.js`, `ui.js`, `assets/`)
- Compatible with our responsive `styles.css`
- Connects with our existing asset pipeline (`assets/models/`, `textures/`)

## Future Use Cases

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Satellite Support Simulation** | Visualize satellite uplink/downlink stations in real terrain |
| **Training Environment** | Teach infrastructure layout, RF line-of-sight, or satellite field maintenance |
| **Wander Mode Integration** | Embed into the free-roam mode for user exploration |
| **Visual Showcase** | Use for screenshots, demos, and marketing materials |
| **Disaster Simulation** | Simulate events like debris impacts on terrain-grounded assets |
| **Mission Builder Plugin** | Allow this scene to be loaded in with user-generated mission conditions |

---

## Development Notes

- This is a **concept** staging repo.
- All future scene tests will be developed in a **`/terrain-test/`** branch that reuses existing LEOS infrastructure.
- Integration with the main simulation will follow after environmental fidelity and performance benchmarks are met.

---

## Next Steps (TBD)

- [ ] Create basic Babylon.js terrain scene with orbit camera
- [ ] Import and place ground station `.glb` model
- [ ] Add skybox and terrain textures
- [ ] Test lighting, shadows, and interaction
- [ ] Package into reusable scene module
- [ ] Connect with UI/UX for user control and visuals
