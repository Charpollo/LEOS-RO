# LEOS: Mission Ready — Mission & Training Framework

## Purpose

This document defines the foundation for how **missions** and **training modules** are conceptualized, structured, and integrated into the LEOS: Mission Ready simulation. Our aim is to provide a unified, extensible approach for building learning content and simulation scenarios that teach users the intricacies of space operations — from introductory concepts to full-fidelity mission rehearsals.

The framework supports both:
- **Baked-in content** built by the LEOS team (Operations 101, Orbital Mechanics, etc.)
- **Expandable mission & training templates** for custom and user-generated content

---

## Vision

LEOS: Mission Ready is not just a simulator — it is a **virtual mission environment**. Users will:
- Learn through realistic simulation and decision-making
- Engage in guided training missions built around real-world space concepts
- Explore core systems, procedures, and best practices used in aerospace
- Build toward advanced, scenario-based challenges

Whether it’s understanding Keplerian elements or responding to a satellite anomaly, every mission and training element should have real stakes, clarity of purpose, and replay value.

---

## Key Goals of the Framework

- **Unified Learning Flow**: Users begin with foundational training and naturally progress toward operational readiness through missions.
- **Realism & Fidelity**: Missions must simulate plausible operational conditions using authentic data structures, interfaces, and time scales.
- **Replayability**: Users should be able to attempt missions multiple times, try different strategies, and see outcome differences.
- **Scalable Design**: Training and missions should be modular and plug-and-play — easy to create, update, and expand.
- **Telemetry-Backed Feedback**: Post-mission data helps users understand what went right or wrong and how to improve.
- **Mission-Embedded Learning**: Training should not only be static (reading) — it should offer direct application in mission contexts.

## Module Types

### 1. **Training Modules (Theory + Application)**

- Cover foundational and advanced aerospace concepts.
- Include embedded visuals, static panels, telemetry examples.
- Feature optional simulation-based follow-ups.
- Examples:
  - Orbital Mechanics 101
  - Using Ground Stations
  - Satellite Subsystems Explained
  - Communications Protocols (e.g., CCSDS)

### 2. **Mission Modules (Scenario-Based)**

- Provide structured simulations where users apply knowledge.
- Contain pre-flight briefings, mid-mission events, and post-mission reports.
- Missions can include objectives like:
  - Deploying a CubeSat
  - Re-establishing communication with a lost satellite
  - Running diagnostics after a potential collision
  - Tracking and mitigating an orbital debris scenario

### 3. **Hybrid Modules (Training Sim + Real-Time Environment)**

- Begin with guided learning and move directly into a scenario.
- Example: “Ground Station 101” ends with launching a small mission to relay data.

## Mission Structure Principles

Each mission or training module should follow these key principles:

1. **Narrative Context**
   - Give the user a purpose.
   - Anchor missions in real-world operations or plausible scenarios.

2. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Start with beginner-friendly objectives and increase difficulty.

3. **Interactivity**
   - Embed interfaces (dashboards, telemetry views, map overlays).
   - Use in-sim UI pop-ups to instruct or provide feedback.

4. **Learning Integration**
   - Reference back to what the user has learned.
   - Tie telemetry or decisions directly to outcomes.

5. **Scoring & Reporting**
   - Include After-Action Reports (AARs) showing performance, data logs, decision time, errors, etc.

## Design for Scalability

All training and mission modules should be developed with future use in mind:
- Ability to remix or chain multiple modules together for certifications
- Create instructor-led paths for classroom use
- Allow for multiplayer expansion in future builds
- Enable downloadable custom content using this standard

---

## Supporting Features

- **Pre-Flight Manual**: Each mission includes a briefing with:
  - Objectives
  - Background
  - Readiness Checklist
  - Estimated Time & Complexity

- **Post-Mission Report**: Each simulation ends with:
  - Success Criteria Results
  - Missed Steps or Faults
  - Replay Option
  - Notes for Improvement

- **Telemetry & Data Views**:
  - Every mission and training should include realistic telemetry, either simulated or drawn from real-world examples.

- **Instructor Support**:
  - Future modules should be designed to allow pause points, checkpoints, and instructor interaction (local or remote).

---

## Future Ideas

- **Certification Paths**: Tie modules together for "LEOS Operator" certification paths.
- **Dynamic Events**: Randomize mission anomalies (e.g., radiation spike, solar flare, etc.) to challenge experienced users.
- **SDA/ISR Mode**: Allow training on space domain awareness using simulated real-time Earth + orbital views.
- **User-Created Missions**: Future SDK support will allow users to create, upload, and share missions built to this format.

---

## Example Mission Ideas

- **Deploy & Operate Your First CubeSat**
- **Catch the Window: Time-Sensitive Launch**
- **Ping Test: Signal Recovery from a Damaged Antenna**
- **Orbit Correction: Low-Fuel Maneuvering**
- **Red Sky Event: Collision Avoidance Maneuvers**
- **Weather Watch: Responding to Solar Interference**

## Final Notes

This framework serves as the backbone for the *LEOS: Mission Ready* learning experience. Whether you're designing your first training module or building a high-fidelity mission based on real orbital events, this structure ensures everything is intuitive, immersive, and interoperable.

All missions and training should reflect LEOS’s core principle:
