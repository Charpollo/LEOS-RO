2. Show real-time physics (no cheating, no approximations)
3. Demonstrate orbit types: LEO, MEO, GEO, Molniya
4. Show performance metrics: 40 FPS on M4 Max
5. "This is more objects than exist in space today - by 20x"

### Live Demo Part 2: The Disaster (10 minutes)
**"Triggering Armageddon"**
1. Interactive placement of rogue satellites
2. Adjust collision parameters (velocity, mass, angle)
3. **PRESS 'K' - TRIGGER KESSLER CASCADE**
4. Watch the cascade propagate in real-time
5. Show debris generation, secondary collisions
6. "In 4 minutes, LEO becomes unusable for 100 years"

### Live Demo Part 3: Real Satellites (10 minutes)
**"Your Satellites, Your Risk"**
1. Load actual TLE data from Space-Track
2. Show Starlink constellation (5,000+ satellites)
3. Predict real conjunction events
4. Demonstrate collision avoidance scenarios
5. "This could happen tomorrow"

### Interactive Session (5 minutes)
**"You Control the Apocalypse"**
- Audience selects collision scenarios
- Vote on disaster parameters
- Watch custom cascades unfold
- "What kills space fastest?"

### Q&A & Call to Action (10 minutes)

## Call to Action

### For Industry
"Schedule a private demo for your constellation. See your actual satellites in our simulation. Predict your real risks."

### For Government
"We can model any threat scenario. ASAT strikes, cascade effects, debris evolution. Classified versions available."

### For Investors
"The space economy is $500B today, $1T by 2030. One cascade ends it all. We're the only tool that can model it."

### For Developers
"It's open source. Fork it. Improve it. Help us save space."
